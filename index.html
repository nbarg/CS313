                I'm from a town in cental Minnesota. I grew up on a pig farm, and 
                went to a high school with less than 500 people in it. I served a 
                mission from September of 2008-2010. I started school in 2011 and 
                will be graduating at the end of this semester. I started school as
                Mechanical Engineering student, but changed to CIT.

                I got married in 2013 to my wife, Cassy. We are going on two years 
                in July. We are also expecting our first child on the 13th of July. 
                We enjoy doing a lot of things, like hiking and exploring. And thats 
                a little about me.
